# The Indifferent Engine Modular Pedalboard
A modular pedalboard system for guitars, bass and vocal effect rigs. 

![4x600mm board render](https://github.com/indifferentengine/ModularPedalboard/blob/main/Renders/Overview1.PNG)

Constructed from 3D printed parts, off-the-shelf 2040 aluminium extrusion and velcro.

Simply print out the modular parts for the size and complexity of board you want and bolt them onto some aluminium extrusion.

# Where to find extrusions

Aluminium extrusions are standardised in width and profile, and are easy to find world-wide.

For this project, you need "2040 Aluminium Extrusion".

Extrusions can be found from many suppliers - often suppliers will cut the extrusions to length for you, simply google "2040 aluminium extrusion cut to length" to locate a supplier. Use the length of extrusion that matches the board width you want. For reference, Adam Paul's prototype board (shown in pictures at the bottom of this page) uses a set of four 600mm aluminium 2040 extrusion.

Here's the supplier I use (UK based):

# Different options

The components are designed to allow the user to build up a board of many different sizes and options.

You can make boards of many sizes with this modular system. You can use 2, 3 or 4 rails and the length of the rails can be cut to whatever width of board you are after.

You could go as small as a 2 rail, 300mm wide board, like this:

![basic 2x300mm board](https://github.com/indifferentengine/ModularPedalboard/blob/main/Renders/Basic_2x300.PNG?raw=true)

Or as big as a 4 rail, 600mm wide board, like this:

![basic 2x300mm board](https://github.com/indifferentengine/ModularPedalboard/blob/main/Renders/Basic_4x600.png?raw=true)

You can even go wider than 600mm if you wanted to, especially if you add extra braces for the center of the board.

There are also a few extra options, I've included:
* A 4 in, 4 out patch bay that can be mounted either underneath or on-top of the board (on-top only for boards smaller than 4 rails). Designed to fit standard 1/4" open style jacks.
* A 2-piece handle that can be printed to go either end of the board (minimum 3 rail boards and up).
* A 2-piece tier support, which can be printed to allow the attachment of extra rails above the main board. These are designed to allow for boss-sized pedals to fit underneath the upper tier.
* An under-board powersupply mount for a T-Rex Chameleon (this is the power supply I have on hand). For 4-rail boards only.

The intention is to continue to support the project and further add to the range of modular parts to allow people to design a huge range of board setups.

# 3D Printing

I print these parts in PLA at 60% infill with 0.32 layer height. All parts print without supports.

# How To Build

Decide how many rails you want on your main board; 2, 3 or 4. You will need to print the following braces:

| Rails  | Braces required                  |
| -------| -------------------------------- |
| 2      | 2x Brace1                        |
| 3      | 2x Brace1, 2x Brace2             |
| 4      | 2x Brace1, 2x Brace2, 2xBrace3   |

Once completed, bolt your braces to the ends of the aluminium extrusion using 8mm M5 bolts and T-slot nuts. Each brace requires 8 nuts and bolts. We recommend glueing some large rubber feet to the bottom of the braces to prevent the board from slipping around on stage.

If you want to add an upper tier you can use tier supports. Tier supports come in two pieces which sandwich together. So for a single upper rail, you will need 4x tier supports. Bolt the supports to both the upper and lower rails using 4x M5 bolts and T-slot nuts.

The patch bay requires 4x M5 bolts and T-slot nuts. The patchbay can be mounted to the top side of the board, or underneath the board in the case that you are building a 4-rail board.

The powersupply mounting for T-rex Chameleon requires 8x M5 bolts and T-slot nuts, and only fits 4-rail boards. It must mount on the back 2 rails.

Handles are printed in 2 parts for each handle, in a similar way to the upper-tier support. Print both sides of the handle, then sandwich them together and bolt to the top side of the board. The handles require 8x M5 bolts and T-slot nuts. These handles can only be used on 3 and 4 rail boards.

Once the rails and other components are all mounted in place, simply cut some 40mm wide heavy-duty velcro carpet to length and stick it to the top of each rail. You're now ready to mount some pedals! Power and audio cabling can be run underneath the rails to keep it tidy, and you can use ziplocks to attach the cabling to the rails to keep it from trailing around under the board.

The following gif shows how a board with 4 rails, handles and an upper tier go together:
